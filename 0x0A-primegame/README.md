# Prime Game

## Description

This project involves solving a competitive game scenario where players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The goal is to determine the winner of the game based on the strategic removal of numbers.

## Concepts Needed

- Prime Numbers: Understanding what prime numbers are and efficient algorithms for identifying them within a range.
- Sieve of Eratosthenes: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
- Game Theory: Understanding win conditions, optimal play, and strategies.
- Dynamic Programming/Memoization: Using previous results to optimize future calculations.
- Python Programming: Loops, conditional statements, arrays/lists, and managing game state.
