UTF-8 Validation Project
Welcome to the "0x04. UTF-8 Validation" project! This project involves validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. To accomplish this task, you will need to apply your knowledge of bitwise operations, understand the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and utilize your Python programming skills effectively.

Concepts Needed:
1. Bitwise Operations in Python:
Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python using operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
Familiarity with Python's bitwise operators.
Python Bitwise Operators
2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
Knowledge of the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
UTF-8 Wikipedia
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets
3. Data Representation:
Understanding how to represent and work with data at the byte level.
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.
4. List Manipulation in Python:
Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
Python Lists
5. Boolean Logic:
Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project effectively. This project will require you to apply bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
