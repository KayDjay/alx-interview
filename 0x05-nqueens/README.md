0x05. N Queens README
The "0x05. N queens" project is an engaging and challenging problem that combines elements of computer science, mathematics, and algorithm design. The main objective is to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard, which is a popular application of the backtracking algorithm. This README provides an overview of the key concepts and resources you will need to complete the project successfully.

Project Overview
In this project, you are required to develop a Python program that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve the N queens puzzle. The solution should be capable of finding all possible arrangements of N queens on an N×N chessboard where no two queens threaten each other.

Key Concepts
Backtracking Algorithms
Definition and Application: Backtracking is a type of algorithm that tries to find solutions to problems incrementally, one piece at a time, and backtracks as soon as it determines that a particular path does not lead to a viable solution.
Resource: Backtracking Introduction
Recursion
Usage in Backtracking: Recursion is used in backtracking algorithms to explore each potential placement of queens recursively.
Resource: Recursion in Python
List Manipulations in Python
Purpose in the N Queens Problem: Lists are used to store the positions of the queens on the board, where each index and its value represents a particular configuration.
Resource: Python Lists
Python Command Line Arguments
Using sys Module: Handling command-line arguments to specify the size of the chessboard (N) and potentially other settings.
Resource: Command Line Arguments in Python
Additional Resources
Mock Interview: Preparing for potential job interviews that may involve solving similar algorithmic problems. Engage in mock interviews with peers or mentors to enhance your problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
