# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project focuses on parsing and processing data streams in real-time using Python programming. The goal is to read from standard input (stdin), handle data in a specific format, and perform calculations based on the input data.

## Concepts Needed

### File I/O in Python

- Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
- [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

### Signal Handling in Python

- Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
- [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

### Data Processing

- Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
- Aggregating data to compute summaries.

### Regular Expressions

- Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
- [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

### Dictionaries in Python

- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
- [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### Exception Handling

- Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
- [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project. This project will help you effectively handle data streams, parse log entries, and compute metrics based on the processed data.
